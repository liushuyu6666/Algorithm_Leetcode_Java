# Solution
To address this question, we establish two key definitions:

1. **Homogeneous String**: A string composed entirely of identical, repeated characters, such as `111111` or `000`.
2. **Complementary Binary Strings**: When every bit in two strings is distinct, these strings are regarded as complementary binary strings. For instance, `11001010` and `00110101` exemplify this. Upon observing them, we partition the bits of the first string into two groups:
   - group 1: [2, 3, 5, 7]
   - group 2: [0, 1, 4, 6]
   the second string uses the same group. This implies that for such complementary binary strings, we select either group to transform them into a homogeneous string. For instance, opting for group 1 and flipping the bits at positions [2, 3, 5, 7] would convert the first string to `11111111` and the second to `00000000`.

In this question, we need to flip the entire column. Therefore, for these two complementary binary strings, after flipping specific columns, they will end up becoming homogeneous strings simultaneously.
