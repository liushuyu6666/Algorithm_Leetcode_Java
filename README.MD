# Overview
This project aims to offer comprehensive Java solutions for all Leetcode questions, with carefully selected benchmark 
questions serving as exemplars for one or multiple labels, highlighting effective problem-solving approaches. While some 
questions may merit revisiting, others may be relatively straightforward to attempt.

This file serves as an index for various types of questions, utilizing benchmark questions to categorize and reference 
different methods.

# Summary
The questions and labels are listed in the `_Summary_` folder.

# Dynamic Programming
Different methods are employed for various sub-labels within dynamic programming, but the key to effective 
problem-solving lies in proper task decomposition.  

At times, Dynamic Programming questions can be transformed into `dfs` (depth-first search) questions as well. The main 
distinction is that `dfs` requires invoking itself recursively.
